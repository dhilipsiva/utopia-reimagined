# The Need for Change

## The Paradox of Scarcity in a World of Abundance

I have always struggled to accept the notion that a downturn in the economy—what many call a “recession”—should force people to go hungry or lose their homes. It seems to defy my common sense: the Sun still shines as it did yesterday, the Earth hasn’t shrunk in size, and the land remains as fertile (if not more, given technological advances) as it was before the market took a plunge. Physically, we’re not any more deprived of energy, water, or space than we were last week. Yet, thousands—even millions—of people across the world can suddenly find themselves unable to afford food or pay rent. That contradiction troubles me deeply.

## Willing Hands, Empty Tables

The part that’s hardest to swallow is that most people in financial distress aren’t lazy or indifferent. Many are willing—sometimes desperately so—to be employed. They want to put in effort, learn new skills, and do whatever it takes to secure their basic needs. But despite the willingness and, in many cases, the ability to contribute, the market doesn’t always reward or even enable their participation.

When an economic downturn hits, companies cut jobs in anticipation of lower profits. Entire industries contract, erasing opportunities for employment. Wages stagnate or decline. Suddenly, countless “willing workers” find themselves out of luck, not because the Earth can’t support them, but because the system that governs our access to resources isn’t functioning in their favor.

## The Failure of Our Shared Systems

We like to imagine that “the market” is a perfectly rational mechanism, balancing supply and demand. In reality, it’s laden with speculation, fear, and power imbalances. A dip in investor confidence can trigger actual job losses, sparking a feedback loop where consumer spending plummets, businesses fold, and more people lose their jobs or see their hours cut.

This leads to a bizarre outcome: the resource itself—food, land, water, human labor—hasn’t vanished, but people’s ability to *pay* for it has collapsed. To put it differently, the real “shortage” is not in raw materials but in the money supply, credit systems, or investor confidence. And when those artificially constrained resources tighten, it’s everyday people who feel the sting first.

## Beyond Just Numbers

A recession isn’t just about the GDP dropping a few percentage points—it’s about families uprooted because they can’t pay rent, parents skipping meals so their children can eat, or patients avoiding healthcare visits because they can’t afford the bill. These aren’t isolated tragedies; they’re part of a global trend that repeats every few years under our current economic systems.

What’s infuriating is the knowledge that the physical means to sustain everyone remain largely unaffected. We don’t lose the Sun during a recession, nor do we magically run out of water. Instead, the system that translates these abundant resources into daily essentials—our economic and political frameworks—fails to distribute them fairly or effectively when times get tough.

## A Personal Impetus for Change

This disconnect—between what we physically have and what our structures allow us to use—has long fueled my desire to imagine something better. It’s not that I deny the realities of recessions or the fact that markets can behave irrationally. Rather, I challenge the very premise that a market downturn must inevitably mean human suffering. Why should temporary monetary shortages or shifts in investor “sentiment” translate into empty plates and lost homes, especially when people are ready and able to contribute?

In this part of this book, *The Need for Change*, I want to explore how we got here, why so many of us feel powerless in the face of these crises, and whether there’s a more just, more resilient way to organize our society. I’ll trace the roots of these systemic failures and clarify why it’s not enough to rely on minor patches or short-term bailouts. Instead, we may need to reexamine the very foundations of what we consider “employment,” “wealth,” and “rights.”

By grounding this conversation in the paradox of abundance versus deprivation, I hope to show that our current problems aren’t due to a lack of resources; they stem from a system that arbitrarily denies access to them when certain economic indicators start flashing red. That realization is both disheartening and empowering: if the resources are still there, then it’s within our collective reach to distribute them more fairly, so long as we find the will and the means to change the rules we live by.


# Echoes of Inequality: A Snapshot of Our Times

You don’t have to be an economist or a political scientist to notice that, in many parts of the world, the rich seem to be getting richer—and at an astonishingly faster pace—especially in times of crisis. During the recent global pandemic, when countless people lost jobs, homes, and even their loved ones, a handful of elites saw their fortunes skyrocket. As bizarre as it appears, it often feels like the system is set up to reward those who already have more than enough, while leaving the rest struggling to survive on the sidelines.

## A System that Rewards the Few

Is it really shocking that billionaires can turn a profit during a recession, or that major corporations can reap record profits amid a pandemic? In hindsight, maybe not. Our current socio-political and economic structures are increasingly skewing toward oligarchy—the concentration of power (and wealth) in the hands of a very small group. When wealth translates to influence, that influence is often used to shape policies and markets in ways that perpetuate the cycle: the wealthy gain even more clout, and the vulnerable are left with fewer opportunities.

You don’t have to look far to see examples. Politicians—funded by wealthy donors—make decisions that benefit corporate interests, sometimes at direct odds with the needs of everyday citizens. These decisions might weaken labor protections, slash taxes for the ultra-rich, or grant monopoly-like privileges to a few big players. Meanwhile, wages stagnate for the majority, social safety nets get cut, and public services deteriorate. It’s not surprising, then, that global inequality continues to grow.

## The Voting Mirage

Where democracy is weak or crumbling, this disparity is even more evident. Vote-buying becomes a vicious cycle: unscrupulous politicians promise short-term benefits or even direct cash handouts to secure votes. Once in office, their loyalty shifts to big donors and corporate backers. The public interest—the very people who cast votes—often comes last. Over time, voters become jaded; they see that changing politicians doesn’t necessarily change the system.

On the other hand, countries with relatively higher degrees of equality also tend to have healthier, more transparent democracies. People in those societies vote because they feel heard, and their participation yields tangible results: better public services, more equitable laws, and accountability from public officials. This is not a coincidence. Governments that prioritize equality foster environments in which citizens can meaningfully engage in the political process, further strengthening democracy. Conversely, in places like North Korea or other authoritarian regimes, the misery is palpable—people have little say, and the gap between the ruling elite and everyone else is enormous.

## An Unspoken Trade-Off

The sad reality is that many citizens in highly unequal societies already sense that the game is rigged. Workers who see their wages stagnate while CEOs collect massive bonuses are acutely aware that the current system favors the wealthy. Yet when survival is at stake, mobilizing against deep-rooted inequality becomes a luxury that many cannot afford. Organizing protests or advocating for policy changes requires time, resources, and information—not easy to come by when your priority is putting food on the table each day.

“Why can’t people put two and two together?” one might ask. But in truth, many already have; the problem is that the levers for effecting change are often controlled by the very groups benefiting most from inequality. The media can be influenced, public narratives can be shaped, and opportunities for meaningful reform can be stifled by those with sufficient wealth and power to do so. Meanwhile, the disenfranchised remain too mired in daily struggles to build a cohesive front for change.

## Lessons from the Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic threw this disparity into sharp relief. While frontline workers—grocery clerks, hospital staff, delivery drivers—risked their lives for modest pay (if they even kept their jobs), global markets rewarded the tech titans and large conglomerates who had the capital to pivot quickly and capitalize on new demands. Many billionaires saw their net worth balloon during the crisis. The paradox is jarring: widespread suffering and unemployment in one corner, explosive wealth gains in another.

At some level, this feels like a moral betrayal: a system that seems to penalize vulnerability and reward exploitation. It underscores the urgent need to question how resources are distributed, who holds power, and what mechanisms ensure—or fail to ensure—a fair shake for the majority.

## Facing the Reality, Fueling the Hope

In acknowledging these hard truths, we’re faced with a choice: accept inequality as an inevitable by-product of “the way things are,” or question whether a different path might be possible. The latter option demands reimagining systems of governance, employment, and economic distribution from the ground up.

- **Could we restructure our economies so that ‘success’ is about maximizing well-being for everyone who is willing and able to contribute?**
- **Is there a way to ensure that essential resources are accessible, regardless of one’s financial status?**  
- **Might there be a model where democracy isn’t just a slogan, but a lived reality that translates into fair representation and robust social protections?**

These are the kinds of questions we must ask if we’re to move toward a more just society. In the chapters that follow, we’ll explore why these disparities persist, how they undermine genuine progress, and what fundamental changes might begin to reverse this tide. Because if we can agree that no system should allow people to become exponentially richer while others starve—especially in times of crisis—then we owe it to ourselves, and to future generations, to envision and create something different.

# A Glimmer of Hope: Imagining a Better Future

When you look around at the inequalities and exploitation of our current world, it’s easy to feel cynical or overwhelmed. Yet despite the bleak realities, a glimmer of hope remains: we have the means—technologically, intellectually, and morally—to reimagine our socioeconomic and political core in a way that centers humanity’s well-being, rather than the profit or power of the few.

## Redefining Our Priorities

At the heart of this transformation is a simple but radical question: **What if our systems were designed to ensure humanity’s survival and flourishing first, rather than enable the exploitation of the vulnerable?** Once we decide that every human being deserves fair access to life’s essentials—and the chance to contribute in a meaningful way—everything else follows.

To move beyond the status quo, we need to identify and protect those rights that make a dignified life possible. Food, water, shelter, healthcare, education, and a livable environment shouldn’t be privileges—they should be guaranteed fundamentals. The moment we assert that these resources belong to everyone by virtue of being human, the old playbook of wealth, power, and exclusion begins to lose its hold.

## Reimagining “Employment”

Traditionally, “employment” has been viewed as labor in exchange for wages, often neglecting other essential forms of contribution like caregiving, parenting, studying, volunteering, or creative pursuits. In a future that aims for genuine equity, we must broaden that concept so that all valuable efforts—be they raising a child or researching a scientific breakthrough—are recognized, respected, and supported.

This new understanding of employment would also include collective responsibilities such as environmental stewardship, community mentoring, and collaborating on public projects. By elevating these roles, society signals that progress isn’t just measured by profit margins or stock prices, but by the well-being and enrichment of all.

## A New Framework for Participation Using Merit Points

To make these ideals a practical reality, we need a fair mechanism that tracks each person’s contributions to society. Think of it as a merit-based points system, similar to the concept used for immigration in some countries but applied more broadly. Under this system:

- **Contributions are Tallied**: Whether formal wage-earning employment, caregiving, volunteering, or studying, each role can earn merit points proportional to its impact on fundamental human rights.  
- **Prioritizing Accessibility**: People who accumulate merit points gain priority in accessing resources—like advanced training, certain luxuries, or queue preferences—while everyone still retains baseline fundamental rights.  
- **Encouraging Active Engagement**: Merit points ensure that contributing to societal well-being is acknowledged, without entirely excluding those who can’t participate at a given moment (due to health, age, or personal crises).

### Smartphones and YAD

Most people already carry a smartphone or something similar. For those who lack one, a standardized **[YAD](https://github.com/dhilipsiva/a-device)** (Yet Another Device) can be provided, ensuring no one is left out of the digital ecosystem. This technology helps track merit points securely and transparently.

## A Quantum-Secure, Local-First, Privacy-Focused Blockchain

Underpinning this entire system is the concept of a **quantum-secure, eventually consistent, and privacy-focused blockchain**, built to manage identity, merit points, and resource distribution. Unlike conventional blockchains that are resource-intensive and often centered around massive server farms, this one would be **local-first** and **offline-capable**—able to keep running even if you temporarily lose internet access. By storing only the data necessary for verification and using robust encryption, it protects personal privacy while still providing transparency where it’s needed.

### Proof of Personhood

Rather than using electricity-guzzling “proof of work” algorithms or hyper-financialized “proof of stake” models, this blockchain employs **proof of personhood**, a protocol designed to ensure that each participant is a unique, real individual. This approach not only thwarts fraud and multiple-identity gaming but also aligns perfectly with the principle that **everyone**—regardless of financial standing—deserves a voice and a baseline set of resources.

## Hope as a Practical Tool

It’s easy to dismiss all this talk as idealism, but hope can be a powerful lever for change when paired with actionable plans. We already have the technology; we just need to direct it toward solutions that honor collective well-being. By defining fundamental rights, rethinking employment, implementing a merit points system, and leveraging cutting-edge yet accessible tech, we can create a world where human dignity and cooperation are built into the very design.

A fairer future isn’t some distant dream—it’s a direct possibility if we choose to invest our collective energy in making it real. The more we imagine what that future might look like, the better equipped we are to build it. So let’s keep the flame of hope burning, and turn our minds to what we can achieve together with the tools already at our disposal.

# Defining the Core

Before diving into the specifics of what truly constitutes our core social contract, let’s make sure we’re on the same page about what “progress” even means. In my view, a *progressive society* is one that continuously advances humanity—intellectually, socially, and ethically—so that each generation starts off better than the one before it. The foundation of that progress? **Knowledge.**

Think about history’s greatest scientific minds—Newton, Einstein, Charles Babbage. They were undoubtedly brilliant, yet they weren’t necessarily *the* most intelligent people ever born. There could have been others with equal or greater potential who never had the chance to realize it—maybe a prodigy who was forced to work endless hours to support a family, a soldier whose life ended in conflict, or a child who simply had no access to education. Every unfulfilled promise of brilliance is a *delay* in humanity’s collective progress, and a delay in progress is a loss not just for an individual, but for all of us who might have benefited from that person’s discoveries or inventions.

If we want the *best* minds to flourish—whoever and wherever they are—we need to guarantee that they have the basics: **an education, sufficient food and water, decent shelter, healthcare (including mental health), reliable communication, and the freedom to move about.** Without these essentials, we risk losing the next great breakthrough, the next lifesaving idea, the next Einstein. So from an objective standpoint, these are not just “nice-to-haves” but **Fundamental Human Rights** that ensure each generation’s capacity to learn, innovate, and thrive.

## “Save the Planet” or “Save Humanity”?

It’s often said we must “save the planet,” but let’s be real: Earth itself will likely persist through cataclysms and mass extinctions, as it has many times before. What we’re truly worried about is *saving humanity*—our species, our civilizations, and the ecosystems on which we depend. If we treat the environment as expendable, we’re effectively destroying the conditions we need to survive. Life will go on, one way or another—it just might not include us.

That’s why **environmental stewardship** has to be woven into the fabric of our fundamental rights. If education secures our intellectual future, then a healthy planet secures our literal home. We cannot call ourselves progressive if we don’t protect the resources and natural cycles that nurture and sustain us.

## All Employment Matters—But Not All Employment Is Salaried

Reimagining “employment” means broadening our definition of valuable contributions. Yes, certain tasks—like engineering, teaching, or medical services—will be salaried or compensated monetarily. But other employment, such as caregiving or studying, is no less vital to societal progress, even if it isn’t tied to a direct paycheck.

For instance, if raising a child were a salaried position, one could imagine opportunists having more children simply for income. That would not only be unsustainable but would also commodify child-rearing in ways that could harm families and communities. Instead, unsalaried employment needs its own form of societal support (e.g., guaranteed access to essential resources, priority in certain benefits, or other forms of assistance) that recognizes its crucial role without turning it into a financial incentive.

## Merit Points

A new framework for participation should reflect that a person’s role and status can change over time. We rely on **merit points** to acknowledge contributions. Someone accumulating merit points through volunteering, studying, or other recognized roles gains priority in certain allocations—while everyone still retains a baseline of fundamental rights.

By carefully balancing **merit-based incentives** for certain roles with **universal support** for essential activities, we can ensure that every crucial human endeavor—whether nurturing a child or pioneering a scientific breakthrough—receives the recognition and resources it needs.

## Building a Shared Foundation

So as we define the *Core* of our new system:
1. **Fundamental Human Rights** ensure that every person can obtain the essentials—enabling them to learn, create, and participate.  
2. **Reimagined “Employment”** acknowledges that, while certain jobs are salaried, others (like parenting or studying) merit societal support—even if they aren’t tied to direct monetary compensation.  
3. **Merit Points System** encouraging all forms of contribution while guaranteeing that everyone has a baseline of rights.

By valuing knowledge, ensuring access to essentials, and safeguarding our environment, we create a foundation where the full spectrum of human potential—whether it’s found in a newborn in a remote village or a teen in an urban center—can unfold. That, to me, is what real progress looks like: maximizing our collective capacity to learn, adapt, and grow, while honoring our responsibilities to each other and the world that sustains us.

# Fundamental Human Rights: The Bedrock of Society

If we’re serious about building a fair and progressive future, then ensuring every individual’s ability to survive—and thrive—must be our primary collective goal. This chapter outlines **Fundamental Human Rights** that form the bedrock of such a society. Each right addresses a basic yet essential human need, without which people can’t fully participate in or contribute to the world around them.

## 1. Education

**Why It’s Essential**  
Knowledge is the cornerstone of humanity’s growth. A society that doesn’t educate its children deprives itself of future innovators, teachers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and artists. When anyone is denied the chance to learn, we all lose out—progress is delayed, and new ideas go undiscovered.

**Key Points**  
- **Universal Access**: Education must be free and compulsory at least up to the age of 18, ensuring everyone gains the skills needed for independent living and civic engagement.  
- **Breadth & Depth**: A robust curriculum that goes beyond rote learning—teaching critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and empathy.  
- **Inclusivity**: Special provisions for those with disabilities or different learning needs so they’re never left behind.


## 2. Food

**Why It’s Essential**  
Food insecurity is one of the most glaring symptoms of a failing system. We produce more than enough food globally, yet millions remain malnourished or hungry.

**Key Points**  
- **Basic Nutritional Standards**: Everyone should have access to a balanced, sustaining diet that fosters good health.  
- **Local Production & Distribution**: Encouraging local agriculture and community gardens can reduce waste, lower costs, and build resilience.  
- **Prioritization**: While everyone’s entitled to essential nutrition, someone can be entitled to additional “luxury” foods or more priority based on merit points (as we'll explore in other chapters).


## 3. Water

**Why It’s Essential**  
Water is life. From hydration to sanitation, water underpins every aspect of human health and dignity.

**Key Points**  
- **Free & Safe**: Clean water must be free at the point of use—unhindered by privatization or cost barriers.  
- **Infrastructure Investments**: Proper filtration systems, piping, and maintenance are crucial, ensuring reliability and safety.  
- **Sustainability**: Monitoring water usage and protecting watersheds remain critical to prevent droughts or pollution.


## 4. Housing

**Why It’s Essential**  
Shelter is fundamental to well-being. A stable home environment fosters mental, emotional, and physical security.

**Key Points**  
- **Universal, Decent Housing**: Everyone deserves a safe and sanitary place to live—basic standards should be guaranteed.  
- **Scalable Solutions**: From micro-housing initiatives to sustainable urban planning, the focus should be on affordability and minimizing homelessness.  
- **Community Integration**: Housing policies should promote diverse, mixed-income neighborhoods, avoiding socioeconomic segregation.


## 5. Medicare (Physical & Mental Health)

**Why It’s Essential**  
Health crises often drive people into poverty, and mental health struggles can isolate individuals from society. No one should have to choose between health and survival.

**Key Points**  
- **Physical Health**: Universal coverage of preventive care, treatments, surgeries, and prescription medicines.  
- **Mental & Emotional Well-Being**: Equal emphasis on mental health services—counseling, therapy, psychiatric support—so individuals aren’t marginalized for conditions outside their control.  
- **Preventive Approach**: Education on nutrition, exercise, stress management, and regular check-ups can drastically reduce long-term healthcare costs.


## 6. Mobility

**Why It’s Essential**  
Freedom of movement is integral to opportunity. Jobs, education, healthcare, and social connections often depend on one’s ability to travel.

**Key Points**  
- **Essential Public Transport**: Subsidized or free access to buses, trains, or shared mobility options, especially for those actively contributing to society.  
- **Infrastructure**: Safe, well-maintained roads, walkways, and bike lanes so individuals at all income levels can travel safely.  
- **Prioritization**: People with higher merit points may get priority during peak times or limited-capacity scenarios.


## 7. Electricity & Communication

**Why It’s Essential**  
Modern life runs on information and connectivity. Without electricity and communication tools, individuals can’t engage in learning, remote work, or digital governance.

**Key Points**  
- **Basic Electric Power**: Sufficient to power lights, charge devices, and run heating/cooling appliances.  
- **Universal Internet & Phone Access**: Communication platforms are gateways to education, telemedicine, banking, and social interaction.  
- **Local Grids & Renewables**: Encourage sustainable energy solutions like solar or wind, particularly for underserved areas.


## 8. Environmental Stewardship

**Why It’s Essential**  
Humans depend on the Earth’s ecosystems for survival—clean air, fresh water, fertile soil, and stable climates. Damaging the environment is ultimately self-destructive.

**Key Points**  
- **Protection of Ecosystems**: Treat nature as an extension of our home—strict anti-pollution and conservation policies.  
- **Sustainable Resource Management**: Prioritize renewable energy and circular economic models.  
- **Planetary Responsibility**: While “saving the planet” might be an overreach, ensuring a favorable environment for humanity is non-negotiable.


## 9. Privacy & Digital Security

**Why It’s Essential**  
As society becomes increasingly digital, personal data is at constant risk of exploitation. Protecting privacy is crucial for freedom of thought, expression, and personal autonomy.

**Key Points**  
- **Data Ownership**: Individuals own their personal data; consent is required for any usage beyond private storage.  
- **Quantum-Secure Encryption**: Future-proofing against evolving security threats ensures data confidentiality.  
- **Local-First Architectures**: Minimizing centralized data repositories helps prevent large-scale breaches.


## 10. Mental Health & Emotional Well-Being

**Why It’s Essential**  
Though grouped with healthcare above, mental and emotional health warrants specific emphasis. A society that overlooks mental health fosters anxiety, isolation, and unproductive tension among its members.

**Key Points**  
- **Safe Spaces & Community Support**: Encourage peer groups, counseling centers, and mental health advocates.  
- **De-Stigmatization**: Normalize seeking therapy or medication when necessary, and offer protective policies in workplaces and schools.  
- **Inclusion**: Support for individuals with disabilities or long-term mental illnesses, ensuring they remain valued members of the community.


## 11. Freedom of Expression & Creative Pursuits

**Why It’s Essential**  
Art, science, music, and innovation flourish in an environment that celebrates free expression. Creativity and critique catalyze growth, spark new ideas, and challenge societal norms.

**Key Points**  
- **Cultural Vibrancy**: Individuals can freely share art, research, and opinions without fear of censorship.  
- **Support Mechanisms**: Grants, community workshops, or collaborative spaces that enable creators to refine and showcase their work.  
- **Audience & Recognition**: While creative work might not always be salaried, society can still reward it with platforms, audiences, and peer-driven appreciation.


## Making Fundamental Rights Real

Defining rights is one thing; ensuring they’re upheld is another. In subsequent chapters, we’ll explore the practical frameworks—like a reimagined definition of “employment” and a merit points system—to support, prioritize, and distribute these rights efficiently.

1. **Governance & Technology**: How distributed, privacy-focused systems can track resource allocation and proof of personhood without compromising autonomy.  
2. **Societal Participation**: Merit-based points, prioritization mechanisms, and how to avoid undue bureaucracy or exploitation.  
3. **Cultural Shift**: Encouraging community awareness that these rights aren’t gifts from above but shared obligations to each other—because when one person thrives, we all benefit.

By laying these foundations, we’re turning high-minded ideals into tangible, day-to-day realities. With each fundamental right protected, each person has the chance to learn, create, and connect, pushing humanity forward. It’s not just about survival, but about unleashing the full range of human potential—an investment in our collective, vibrant future.
