# The Rights Nobody Has to Earn

This directory is the whole of *The Rights Nobody Has to Earn*: the epigraph,
the opening note, the derived chapters in computed order, Part V, and the
method part. The numbered chapters between the opening note and Part V are
the derived spine — their order is computed from the dependency
stratification of the constitution in `../new-book-plans/constitution.nibli`,
and their claims are pinned by the `*.pins.nibli` files beside them. Exactly
three elements are exempt from the derivation gate and labelled so in their
own text: the opening note, Part V, and the method part.

Two files are deliberately unnumbered — `epigraph.md` and `method.md` —
because the prose sweeps in `../verify.sh` glob the numbered files only: the
epigraph is a poem, and the method part must quote the machinery the sweeps
forbid everywhere else. Do not renumber either; the naming is load-bearing.
Run `../verify.sh` to check every pinned claim against the constitution.

than in the chapters because the chapters are reader-facing prose; this
