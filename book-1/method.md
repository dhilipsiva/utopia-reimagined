# The Method

This part is optional, and it is a different kind of reading. The note at the
front of this book promised that if you ever wanted to see the machinery, the
last part would show it. The fifth part closed by promising what, exactly: the
rules as they are actually written, the checks that run, the failures they
caught, and the things I wanted that the logic refused. This is that part.
Everything between the note at the front and the fifth part was prose a
machine had checked; the note, the fifth part and this one are me speaking —
but where Part V argued, this part shows.

Two ground rules, stated here so you can hold me to them. First: every English
sentence in this part is mine. You will see rules exactly as they are written
in the files and the machine's error messages exactly as it prints them; what
you will not see is the machine's English translation of any rule, or a proof
transcript — it renders no prose in this book. Where a quoted line is wider
than the page, it is broken to fit and nothing else about it is changed; the
files hold each statement whole. Second: everything shown here is runnable.
The book's repository is public — it holds the constitution, the chapters,
the pins and the checks — and one command re-checks the claims the chapters
stand on, building the engine from its own public repository before any pin
runs.
This part is the guide to that machinery, not a substitute for it. The
repository is the appendix.

Why does this part exist at all? Because a book that says "a machine checked
these promises" and then keeps the machine out of sight has asked for exactly
the kind of trust the rest of the book abolishes. The chapters are the
intuition. The files quoted here are the machinery. The checks described here
are the evidence. You are owed all three, in one object, and this is where the
other two live.

## The rules as written

The society you have been reading about is a file. Everything the record may
say is written in a small formal language read by a reasoning engine called
nibli, and the file — the constitution — is the single source every chapter
was gated on. Here are three of its lines, exactly as they appear:

```
entitled(every person, event { eats() }).
entitled(every person, event { dwell() }).
entitled(every person, event { believe() }).
```

That is what a floor right looks like. One line for each thing owed, and the
two words that carry the book are the plainest ones: *every person* — not
every citizen, every member, every adult, every contributor. The wrapper
around the owed thing is not decoration either: the file's own margin notes
record the measurement that removing it kills the protection the next
sections describe. The floor is not a preamble. It is load-bearing text in a
running system, and the current full list — like every figure in this part —
lives in the repository, not on this page, for a reason I will come to.

Here is the rule that makes someone a prisoner — the only rule in the file
that does:

```
all $offender: all $victim: injure($offender, $victim) &
judge(Court, $offender) & ~permits(Appeals, $offender) &
~broken(Court) & ~defend($offender) & ~free($offender)
-> prisoner($offender).
```

Read it slowly once, because being readable in one breath is the point. A
recorded injury, with a victim. A court's recorded judgment. No standing
appellate relief. A court that is not itself marked broken. No derived
defense. Not already free. Then, and only then: prisoner. Every conjunct is a
recorded fact or the visible absence of one, and there is nothing else — no
second route, no discretion, no "unless circumstances warrant". When chapter 13
called imprisonment the one thing this society takes, this rule is the whole
of what it was describing.

And here is the rule the voiding chapters orbit — the one that can declare a
person's word worthless:

```
all $a: all $b: all $audited: permits(Review, $a) &
permits(Tribunal, $b) & judge($a, $audited) & capture($a, $audited) &
~deceive($a, $audited) & judge($b, $audited) & capture($b, $audited) &
~deceive($b, $audited) & ~($a = $b) & ~parent($a, $b) & ~parent($b, $a) &
~married($a, $b) & ~married($b, $a) & ~sibling($a, $b) & ~sibling($b, $a) &
~broken($a) & ~broken($b) & ~rotten($a) & ~rotten($b)
-> false($audited).
```

It is long because it counts signers, not signatures: two people, each
credentialed by a different body, each having examined and documented the
person themselves, neither lying about them, and — the conjunct chapter 5
turns on — not the same person twice, not each other's parent, spouse or
sibling, neither carrying a mark. Some of those guards have nothing to catch
in the shipped record; they are kept armed for the day an assumption stops
holding, and the sabotage fixtures described in the checks section of this
part are what prove, rather than assert, that they still decide nothing
today.

Two shorter blocks do more work than everything above. The first closes what
may be *written*:

```
admits("free").       admits("hears").      admits("home").
admits("injure").     admits("judge").      admits("married").
```

The record's base vocabulary is declared, name by name, and a ground fact in
any other vocabulary is refused at the moment of writing. The second closes
what may only be *concluded*:

```
derived_only("false").
derived_only("reward").
derived_only("prisoner").
```

A name in this block may never be asserted at all — every appearance of
`prisoner` in the record must be the conclusion of a rule, which is chapter
1's most-guarded sentence made mechanical: "the conclusions that matter are
not writable. They are only derivable." These are two different guards on
two different doors — one closes the record's vocabulary, the other makes a
name conclusion-only — and the book has been careful never to describe them
as one. One name sits differently from everything around it: `person`. It
has producing rules *and* ground entries — the roster has to start
somewhere, and released people re-enter it by rule — so it is a conclusion
the machinery can reach that the record must nonetheless admit. *What counts
as evidence* and *what may be written* are therefore different sets,
`person` is the whole of the difference between them, and chapter 1 put
personhood on its evidence list for precisely that reason.

Try to break the first closure. Add one flattering fact the record does not
admit — `rich(Adam).` — and the engine answers at assert time:

```
[Reasoning Error] `rich` is not admitted vocabulary: this knowledge
base declared its base vocabulary closed with `admits("…")`, and
`rich` is not in it. Add `admits("rich")` ABOVE the first `rich`
assertion if this relation really belongs in the record — a visible,
reviewable edit, which is the point.
```

I did not write that error message, and its last clause is the engine
agreeing with chapter 1 in its own words: widening the record is a loud,
reviewable act, never a fact somebody quietly types.

One honest note on why you are seeing excerpts and not the whole file. It is
not length. A constitution like this is at its truest where you can run it,
not where I can frame it — printed in full here, it would be text; in the
repository, it is a system that answers back. The note at the front promised
that this part shows all of it; the way it shows all of it is by handing you
the place where all of it runs. The full file is dedicated to
the public domain, and the repository is
`github.com/dhilipsiva/rights-nobody-has-to-earn`. Clone it — and the
engine's repository beside it, which the check will name if it is missing —
then run the one command, `./verify.sh`. The pins pass, or this book has a
defect its author did not know about.

## The order of the chapters, and the tools that got it wrong

The chapters of this book are in a computed order. I chose the words in them;
I did not choose their sequence.

The mechanism: every relation in the constitution sits in a layer. At the
bottom are the record's plain words — the things the world may report, like
an injury, a judgment, a marriage, a lesson heard. Above them sit the
conclusions those words feed, and above those the conclusions *those* feed —
personhood, imprisonment, everything owed — up to the marks the audit leaves,
which feed a duty that nothing then reads: the chain ends one step later
than it once did, which is chapter 14's whole story. A rule's conclusion
never sits below something it reads. The engine computes those layers from the file, a script
turns the layers into a chapter order, and the book follows it: the chapter
about a relation cannot come before the chapters about what it rests on. The
computed table — how many relations, how many derived, how many layers, and
the full list of which sits where — lives in a planning file in the
repository, inside a block marked *generated*, and a check fails the build
the moment that block disagrees with the constitution.

You have already felt this order, whether or not you noticed. The book opened
on the record itself — what may be written, and by whom — because everything
else rests on it. It ended, before Part V, on the audit — the layer where
the chains run out — because nothing rests on it. Every chapter in
between sits where its subject sits in the layering: the voiding chapter
follows the chapter on the pens because the voiding rule reads the pens'
conclusions. The order of the book is the direction the rules read, and the
check that guards the spine fails the moment the two disagree.

That check exists because of a failure worth telling. The first version of
the spine was computed correctly — and then the constitution changed
underneath it, and nothing in the repository noticed. The numbers were not
wrong when written; they were wrong when read, which is worse, because every
reader after the change was being shown a careful, precise, stale answer.
The repair was not "be more careful". It was: stop letting a hand-maintained
copy exist at all.

The repository keeps one tool that got this wrong, on purpose, as a
standing exhibit: a small script that tried to compute the layers itself,
by hand-rolled parsing. It cannot see inside the `event { … }` wrapper you
met a page ago — so it never sees the floor at all. It looked sound, it
agreed with itself perfectly, and it disagreed with the engine on every
figure it printed. It is still in the repository, labelled wrong, kept as
the standing argument for taking every figure from the engine that actually
runs the rules. The spine generator carries the history of a second: its
own first form rebuilt the dependency graph out of text-matching rules — a
second implementation of the engine's layering, maintained by someone who
could not see it — and it disagreed with the engine in three places, two of
its numbers right only because two of its errors cancelled. The corrected
generator records that history in its own header, where the next person
tempted to reimplement will find it. Even the fixture-regeneration
instructions in the repository — the commands that rebuild the sabotaged
constitution copies the checks section describes — have been wrong twice,
including once in a way that matched nothing and silently wrote a
byte-identical copy: a fixture that tested nothing while looking freshly
made.

I am telling you this in the part that is supposed to earn your confidence
because it is the shape of the whole method. Every tool written to check the
machine became a thing the machine had to check. The response each time was
not resolve; it was structure — regenerate instead of transcribe, point
instead of copy, and make every checker prove it can fail before trusting a
word it says. That is also why this part quotes so few numbers: a figure
copied onto this page joins the class of things that rot, and the repository
is where the living figures are.

## What the logic refused

The conviction rule you read above refuses to convict anyone whose appeal
has been granted — the `~permits(Appeals, $offender)` conjunct. I wanted to
write the guarantee that ought to sit beside it. Every prisoner may appeal.
As a rule, one line:

```
all $x: prisoner($x) -> permits(Appeals, $x).
```

The engine's answer, exactly as printed:

```
[Stratification Error] Unstratifiable negation: strongly-connected
component containing 'prisoner' -> 'permits' (negative)
```

A universal right of appeal cannot be expressed in this constitution.

Follow the loop once, because it is the same loop the whole book stands on.
Conviction reads the *absence* of appellate permission. My rule derives that
permission *from* conviction. So the conclusion would feed the very absence
it was read from — reasoning passing through its own result — and the engine
refuses the shape. Not the policy: the shape. You have seen this refusal
twice already, from the reader's side, in the chapter on prisoners remaining
persons: it is what stopped the heresy law an attacker would write, and what
stopped the persons-only shield a careful designer would write. This is the
third case, and the difference is only whose rule died: the same wall, met
from inside, by the author. One mechanism, no special pleading, and none of
the three outcomes chosen by whoever was writing that day.

That chapter also named the trap, and it applies to me exactly as printed
there: a refusal leaves the *loose* rule in force. When the engine refused my
guarantee, prisoners did not get a right of appeal — relief stayed what it
was, an act somebody performs, granted case by case, with the cost the book
prices where it weighs that default: a person whose case nobody takes up
stays held. Being told no is not being kept safe. The refusal told me the
guarantee I wanted cannot exist in this shape, and that what exists instead
would keep running whether or not I made my peace with it.

A second refusal, so you can see the wall does not soften when the intention
is kind. The design lets a convicted person earn their sentence shorter, and
the obvious way to write that is release earned from inside:

```
all $x: prisoner($x) & reward($x) -> free($x).
```

```
[Stratification Error] Unstratifiable negation: strongly-connected
component containing 'prisoner' -> 'free' (negative)
```

Conviction reads *not already free*; a release derived from conviction loops
straight back through it. Release conditioned on conviction is structurally
unavailable here — which is why, in this book, release is an entry someone
writes, never an output the machinery computes, and it carries the
concession chapter 1 already made: the entry does not say whose decision it
records. The book calls that refusal the firewall rather than a bug, and I
have kept it.

What it felt like, since the opening note promised I would say: not like
being corrected. Like leaning on a wall I had built myself and finding it did
not care that I was its builder. The machine holds no opinions about appeals
or mercy. It found a shape twice, and both times the thing it handed back was
a design honester than my draft of it — not because it is wise, but because
it cannot be talked out of anything, including by me.

## The checks, and the check on the checks

One command runs everything: `./verify.sh`, at the root of the repository.
It runs, in order: the spine check against the constitution, the sweeps
that keep the chapters' prose inside its rules, the guards on what nothing
may read, then — after rebuilding the engine from source and printing the
engine commit it built — the full pin suite and the sabotage fixtures. It
stops at the first failure, naming the claim that stopped being true. The
rebuild-and-print exists because this repository once spent three days
running a stale binary to a green result, and a check that does not pin
down *what is doing the checking* is a rumor with a progress bar.

The script's own history is the honest part, so here it is in the register
this part owes you — the claim, then where it broke.

The suite reports its runtime; for months it claimed about fifteen minutes,
and the real figure was closer to fifty. Durations printed there are now
measured and dated, and trusted only until re-measured.

The pin files can carry control statements — rules loaded deliberately so a
query can show what they change. The first control mechanism left its
statement in the knowledge base after the check, so every pin below one ran
against a quietly widened base. That was not theoretical: measured while
repairing it, a conviction pin passed against a copy of the constitution
with the conviction rule deleted outright — the greenest possible light,
certifying nothing. Controls are now scoped: the engine itself, not
discipline, puts the base back.

The sweep that keeps engine jargon out of the reading chapters failed, as
first written, to catch the exact leak it was written for. It earned its
place only after being made to fail against a sabotaged copy — and that
became the house rule for every check in the script: sabotage first, trust
after. A check that has never been watched failing is not yet a check.

The pin suite itself is the book's claims made executable. Each chapter has
a companion file of pins — a query against the constitution and the verdict
it must return:

```
? prisoner(Adam).
# => TRUE
```

The whole set runs on every check, each file declares how many pins it
carries so a file cannot be quietly hollowed out, and a changed verdict
stops the build and names the chapter whose sentence just became false.

One of the sweeps deserves its own paragraph, because it polices me. The
chapters you read are forbidden — mechanically, by the same script — from
containing counted claims: no "the floor is eight rights", no headcount of
the sheltered, not because numbers are vulgar but because every counted
claim in this book that was ever checked turned out to be wrong, not stale —
wrong. The floor has been six, then ten, then eight. The rule the sweep
enforces is: state the rule that produces the count, never the count.
"Shelter derives for every confined person and for nobody else" survives
every cast change; the headcount it replaced was wrong on the day it was
checked and would have gone stale again at the next ruling. This part sits
outside the sweeps by its filename, deliberately — the error messages
quoted here would trip the jargon sweep, and this very paragraph's examples
would trip the counting one — so it holds itself to the doctrine the hard
way, which is why the figures here point at the repository instead of
standing on this page.

Some pins are stranger, and they are this method's most honest invention.
The book argues about flaws the design still has — chapters stand on them.
Those flaws are pinned too, marked as defects, with the marker recording
what would flip them. From chapter 12's file, exactly as written:

```
:defect "a totality guard: an amendment that declares no target has no force"
? become(Amend_Sneak, Law).
# => TRUE
```

An amendment that declares no target still becomes law here — a real hole,
and chapter 12's argument depends on it being real. If a future edit quietly
fixed it, the suite would not celebrate; it stops the build and says, in its
own words, that this is a repair, not a regression — find the chapter that
calls this a flaw and rewrite it, then drop the marker in the same commit.
The markers in the pin files are the complete list of declared flaws — a
count here would rot, the markers are the list — and each one is a tripwire
in both directions: the flaw cannot silently persist, and it cannot silently
vanish while the prose goes on confessing it.

The last class of check exists because of a limit in the logic itself. The
engine only ever adds conclusions as facts are added — it never retracts on
its own — so no probe stacked *on top* of the constitution can test what the
constitution refuses or restricts. Every claim of the form "remove this line
and the world loses that" would stay an argument forever. So the repository
keeps sabotaged copies of the constitution — each differing from the real
one in exactly one deliberate way: a line deleted, a line changed, a line
added — and the suite verifies each copy differs in exactly the promised
shape, then runs pins against the sabotaged world to show the loss actually
happens. When this book says the multi-sig's dormant guards decide nothing
today, or that one added credential route would let a carried void count, a
fixture executed that claim. It is the one place in the method where a
removal is run rather than argued.

There is a second thing to say about the fixtures, and it is a weakness
rather than a strength, so it belongs here rather than in a footnote.
Sabotaged copies exist for a few deletions — a seat, a court's standing —
and those are covered on purpose, every run. The constitution's margins
record other deletions that would do comparable damage and have no
fixture: the evidence behind somebody's placement, the line that makes
the duty-bearer answerable. Those still turn some chapter's pins red,
which sounds like a safety net and is not, because they do it only where
a chapter happened to argue about the deleted fact and pinned it for
reasons of its own. Coverage outside the fixtures is an accident of what
the chapters chose to say, never a guarantee, and the constitution's own
note records the tally of noticed deletions moving twice in two days as
the suites grew. A deletion nobody happened to pin is a deletion nothing
sees. I would rather write that down than let the green tick imply
otherwise.

Now the paragraph this part exists to hold, beside the machinery it
qualifies. Everything above runs, and a stranger can run it: clone the
repository, one command, the pins pass. Here is what that does not mean.
Every probe, fixture and refusal in this book's repository was written by me
and by AI sessions working with me, against a cast of a few dozen
record-people. No one has independently reimplemented the checker. No
outside red team has attacked this constitution. And the engine that blesses
the book shares the book's author. Two things narrow that, and neither
closes it. In this repository: the sabotage fixtures, the one place a
removal is executed rather than argued. Upstream, in the engine's own
repository, the engine — not this constitution — is checked against work
that is not its own: external solvers are run as referees over the fragments
of the logic they can hear, though each starts from the engine's
already-compiled output, so the language front-end sits outside them; the
criterion that refuses unstratifiable rules is implemented a second time
from its mathematical statement rather than from the engine's code, and the
two must agree on every random program thrown at them; a proof assistant's
kernel checks model-level proofs of the core algorithms; mutation and fuzz
testing beat on the rest. The engine's guarantees document holds that
inventory in the register I have tried to keep here — state the guarantee
flatly, then name where it stops. So, flatly, where this one stops: every
verification artifact in the engine's repository is authored, run and
interpreted inside that repository. No one outside this project has verified
the engine. I will not promise you a red team I do not have. The suite is
public and it is runnable, and that is not a defense — it is a standing
invitation to become the outside reader this book is still missing.

## The last page

The book ends here, so let me say what it was. Chapters describing a society
from its rules outward, checked by a machine that cannot be flattered; one
part of argument, mine, where the machine has no say; and this part, which
put the machine itself on the table. The confessions along
the way were the product working. The refusals were the design holding. What
I could not defend, I said so, out loud, in the plainest words I could find.

One thing this book has deliberately not told you, and it is the largest
thing. It has described what a society is when certain things cannot be
taken from anyone — and it has said almost nothing about how to build one.
What it would cost. Who would go first. How anything arrives at scale, from
bread to housing to the people who show up when the alarm sounds. Those
questions are real, they are answerable, and they deserved better than a
final chapter's gesture at them.

They are the next book. This one was the destination; that one is the road.
If you have read this far — past the rules, past the failures, past the
paragraph where I told you exactly who has not yet checked this work — then
you are the reader that book will be written for.
